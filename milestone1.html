    <li><strong>What do you want the web site to accomplish?</strong><br> This site's purpose would be to educate people on skin care treatment options. Those people may desire more for their skin but have little knowledge about what they can do. I would also like to gain clientle for my Esthetic business.</li>
    <li><strong>Who is your intended audience?</strong><br> My intended audience would be potential clients. I would target mostly women in their 30s & 40s who desire to preserve or correct their skin with skin treatments.</li>
    <li><strong>What type of content might be included in your site?</strong><br> The site's content would include an organized treatment plan or plans based on the main concern of the visitor to the site. There will be pictures and cost averages to help the visitor understand their options.</li>
