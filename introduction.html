    <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong><br>I've lived in 3 states. I started off in Wisconsin, then moved with my family to the Carolinas and also spent three years in Colorado before moving back to NC. I love to travel and have been all over the US, Mexico, Italy and Okinawa. My Husband and I are planning to visit main-land Japan in April (if we are allowed and it is safe for us to do so). For the past 15 years my main objective has been to be Mom. Raising my daughter has been my biggest focus and life drive.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong><br>I am and have been an Esthetician for 13 years. I work in a Spa setting but also oversee 6 other Estheticians in an educational/managerial role.</li>
    <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong><br>I have attended technical collage since 2010. Ever since the market crash I have wanted to get into a more stable career. I have pursued the sciences and various computer degrees just trying to figure out what would work for me. I have finally decided on Web Development and should be finished with my associates in Web Technologies at the end of next Fall.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong><br>Windows 10 Pro</li>
    <li><strong>Courses I'm taking, and why:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>web110: Internet/Web Fundamentals - required for IT Web Technologies degree</li>
      <li>web120: Intro to Internet Multimedia  -    " </li>
      <li>csc143: Object-Oriented Programming -   "</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Funny Story to remember me by:</strong><br>My husband and I currently take care of 7 cats. He started off with a lot more! They are neighborhood cats and are considered feral. We've gotten them "fixed", attended to them with a local NP vet and keep them well fed. We have been caring for some of them for over 10 years. They usually hang out on our front porch and entertain neighbors, as well as those passing by.</li>
  <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong><br>My dream job and purpose for pursuing a career in IT is to work from "home". I would love to travel and do jobs remotely, while also utilizing my creative and problem solving skills.</li>
